# DCGAN_anime_generator

Anime avatar generator using DCGAN. Not finished, since multiple tests are still required to be done, but it starts to generate things that looks like anime faces.

Best results so far after 2000 epochs:

Huge thanks to gwern (https://www.gwern.net/Faces#) to provide a guide using an styleGAN.
The dataset I used to train my GAN comes from Danbooru2018, and the faces were cropped using nagadomis face recognition. (https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface)
